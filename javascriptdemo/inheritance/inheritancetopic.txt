suppose HP has developed a basic calculator
as follows:
class BasicCalculator{
    addition(){}
    multiplication(){}
    substraction(){}
    division(){}
}

After developing the programs , they have deploed in server, 
users start using the Basic Calcularor Application, after some years, HP decided
to develop Scientific calculator

class ScientificCalculator{
    sin()
    tan()
    cos()
}

After deploying the scientific calculator, end users raised a concern that
it does not have basic operations

Now HP has two choice
1. they can develop separately all basic functions
2. they can extend

Conculsion: inheritance provides code reuable

Types of Inheritance:
1. Simple Inheritance
2. Multilevel Inheritance
3. Hierarchical Inheritance
4. Hybrid Inheritance
